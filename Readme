In this research project, I was looking for Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to improve the quality of geodata source retrieval in Spatial Data infrastructures (SDIs) using semantic keywords for the geographic phenomena requested. For example, a user wants to answer this spatail question: "How much is the concentration of bold eagels in Holland National Parks?". In this question, "parks" and "eagles" are geographic phenomena and if users search to find relevant datasets in a Dutch national geospatial information brokers such as PDOK or National geo-registry, the results of their search might be empty. Simply because the keywords recorded in metadata are "parken" and "dier (animal)" or "vogels (birds)".

To address this problem, I used English WordNet and Google translate API to help different users with language limitations and specific domains by capturing the semantic and linguistic content in metadata. Therefore, when a query executes in English, the algorithm reformulates and enriches queries based on the synonyms, hyponym, and hypernym gathered from the English WordNet and the results of the semantic keywords is tranlsted to Dutch and matched with metadata. This affects the recall and precision of geodata retrieval. This approach causes improvement in the precision and recall of geo-datasets by 1% and 22% respectively.

For query expansion, I developed python codes as shown in the below. Query expansion in WordNet is carried out in five phases. The first phase represents hierarchal relations and computing synsets (i.e., synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms) of keywords. The second and third phases are computing the similarity and semantic overlay, respectively. Next, the query expansion results are translated into Dutch. Finally, the SPARQL query is executed against RDF metadata, and keywords are matched with metadata.
